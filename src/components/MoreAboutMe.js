      <h1>More About Me</h1>
      <p>
        In my career I started out as a Sales Executive where I gained
        experience in Sales, Marketing, Market Research and International
        Business Development for 5years. I pioneered new product launch across 3
        regions in Nigeria and increased company's clients database.

        Out of my passion to explore more, I started self learning Software
        Engineering with FreeCodeCamp, Udemy and Youtube. After which I got a
        new position as a Software Engineer Intern with Robots Limited where I
        worked with Senior Software Engineers and crossfunctional teams members
        on projects. I currently work with Gugugeeks Royalty Limited as a Full
        Stack Developer.

      <p>
        I am a curious person and love learning. In addition, when I am not
        coding I play the piano, love mixing sound and also sound design.
