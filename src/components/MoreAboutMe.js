      <p>
        In my career I started out as a Sales Executive where I gained
        experience in Sales, Marketing, Market Research and International
        Business Development for 5years which I also gained Google Digital
        Marketing Certification in my quest to stay upto date in this field.

        Out of my passion to explore more, I started out in Tech in 2020 during
        Covid period by learning Data Analytics where I gained Google Data
        Analytics professional Certification after which I feel I could explore
        more as a creative person, this led me to Software Engineering path. <br/> I
        started self learning Software Engineering with FreeCodeCamp, Udemy and
        Youtube. After months of self learning I got a new position as a
        Software Engineer Intern with Robots Limited where I worked with Senior
        Software Engineers and other teams members on projects.{" "}

        I am a curious person and love learning. In addition, when I am not
        coding I produce music, I play the piano, drumset, love mixing sound and
        also sound design.
