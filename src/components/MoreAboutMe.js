      <h1>More About Me</h1>
      <p>
        In my career I started out as a Sales Executive where I gained
        experience in Sales, Marketing, Market Research and International
        Business Development for 5years. I pioneered new product launch across 3
        regions in Nigeria and increased company's clients database.

        Out of my passion to explore more, I started out in Tech in 2020 during
        Covid period by learning Data Analytics where I gained Google Data
        Analytics Professional Certification after which I feel I could explore
        more as a creative person, this led me to Software Engineering path.{" "}
        <br /> I started self learning Software Engineering with FreeCodeCamp,
        Udemy and Youtube. After months of self learning I got a new position as
        a Software Engineer Intern with Robots Limited where I worked with
        Senior Software Engineers and other teams members on projects.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        I am a curious person and love learning. In addition, when I am not
        coding I play the piano, love mixing sound and also sound design.
